Introduction
############

This project aims to give a ready-to-start environment for the integration of Makeblock boards in Raspberry Pi projects.
That purpose to start quickly without the needs of losing time on installation.
This environment is intended to be for Education with all the main packages already installed.

As an example, a rover robot has been built in MakerSpace parts to illustrate the possibility of Raspberry Pi with MegaPi and some sensors.
The environment also includes communication protocol between a Makeblock board and RPI based on PySerial.
Finally, some examples working with Makeblock boards has been given such as Opencv, ROS and Kinect examples.
