Introduction
============

This project aims to give a ready-to-start environment for the integration of Makeblock products in Raspberry Pi projects.
This environment is intended to be for Education with all the main packages already install.
As example, a rover robot has been built in MakerSpace parts to illustrate the possibility of Raspberry Pi with MegaPi and some sensors.
The environment also includes communication protocol between a Makeblock board and RPI based on PySerial.
Finally, some example working with Makeblock board has been given such as opencv, ROS and Kinect examples.
