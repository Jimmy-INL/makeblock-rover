Introduction
============

To go to Mars or cross row crops, a robot needs a special structure! The rover is a four wheel differential-drive robot.
The platform features a passive articulated suspension system, that allows the chassis to adapt to the ground
morphology and its four drive wheels to remain in contact with the substrate when overcoming obstacles.
It can even climb obstacles until 7cm.

In addition, the platform purpose to equip the robot with sensors and actuators as you want to fit your needs.
As example, you can add some LEDs, a temperature sensor, a pan/tilt mechanism with a camera or even a robotic arm.
