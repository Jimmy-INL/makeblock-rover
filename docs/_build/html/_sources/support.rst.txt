The easiest way to get help with the project, help to improve and add contents to this docs is to contact me joachim.honegger@gmail.com.

This email is also available for support.

The other good way is to open an issue on Github. To do this, you can follow this tutorial (`creating an issue`_) or this one (`opening an issue from code`_).
